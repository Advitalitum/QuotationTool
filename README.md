### Simple quotation mark tool

It can be useful, for example, when copying the column values of an SQL query to the condition of another query

When you paste or modify text in the **Input** textarea, each line is enclosed in quotation marks, and a comma is placed at the end of it (if it is not the last line)
The result is placed in **Result** textarea and automatically copied onto clipboard

If you are concerned about security issues, you can simply copy [index.html](https://github.com/Advitalitum/QuotationTool/blob/main/index.html) on your computer or wherever you want
